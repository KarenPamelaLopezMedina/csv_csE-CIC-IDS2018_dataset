# csE-CIC-IDS2018 CSV files
Hi, I downloaded the csE-CIC-IDS2018 dataset from https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/ids-2018.html
using the AWS CLI. 
Here I want to share with you the csv files.

After 1.5day of downloading, 2 folders are downloaded:
- Original Network Traffic and Log data
- Processed Traffic Data for ML Algorithms (6.41Gb)

The first one provides us the enterily dataset without preprocessing.
In the second one is the whole dataset preprocessed and shown in csv files.

The total size of the download is 452.8Gb, including the csv files.

Greating and my best wishes. Karen Pamela
